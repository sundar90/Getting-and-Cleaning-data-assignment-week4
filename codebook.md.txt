##This document contains the details about the approach taken to convert the human activity dataset to a tidy dataset
1.The variable names of training and test dataset were extracted from the file features.txt and was stored in the variable "features"
2. The data from test and training files were loaded into the datasets "test" and "train" respectively.
3. The train and test datsets were given variable names from the features dataset.
4. The "test" and "train" datsets were merged using rbind function to create dataset "activity" thus acheiving task 1
5 . For convenience we skipped to task 3 to give meaningful names to the variable names using the make.names() function
6. Created the meanM and stdm by extracting only the cols containing mean and standard deviation respectively. These two datsets were again merged to create the new dataset activity_meanstd thus acheiving task 2
8. For task 4 labels were created;below are the details
	train_label --> reads the activity label code(from 1 to 6) for training data
	test_label -->	reads the activity label code(from 1 to 6) for test data
	train_subject--> reads the subject label code for training data
	test_subject -->reads the subject label code for test data
   The labels corresponding to subhjet and activity were merged to create a single subject and activity label respectively
   The "subject_label" and "activity_label" were added as columns to the activity_meanstd dataset
9. For task 5 the updated "activity_meanstd" dataset was grouped by activty_label and subject_label to calculate mean for each label. Then summarise function was used to calculate the mean for each activity and subject to populate the final dataset final_ds
